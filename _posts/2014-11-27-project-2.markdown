description: One of my first original game ideas, Chest Quest was a really fun, ambitious project I had. I never got around to completing it, but it was a valuable experience nontheless. I got intimate with the SDL2.0 library in C++ and learned a lot about sprite animation and game loops. Maybe I will revisit this project one day, as it is a really cool idea and I still look at the design docs sometimes.
