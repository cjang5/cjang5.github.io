                    <p>My name's Christopher Jang, but you can call me Chris. I study Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm currently a sophomore and am still learning so much every day. I am currently interested in interning with a software company/startup so as to expand my knowledge and narrow my interests further.</p>
